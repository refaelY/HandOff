Empowering accessibility through head control
Description: In a world where digital interaction is ubiquitous, it's essential to ensure that everyone, 
including individuals with disabilities, can access and utilize computer technology effectively. 
This project addresses the critical challenge of enabling people with disabilities to control their
computers effortlessly, enhancing their digital independence and inclusivity.

**Problem**:
People with disabilities often face barriers when it comes to accessing and controlling computers.
Traditional input methods such as keyboards and mice may not be suitable for individuals with limited 
motor functions or those who cannot use their limbs effectively.
This limitation hampers their ability to engage in educational, professional, and leisure activities,
hindering their overall digital participation and social integration.

**Solution**:
The innovative solution developed in this project empowers individuals with disabilities by offering computer control
through the simple movements of their head. This revolutionary approach caters to users with various mobility 
impairments, allowing them to navigate their computers with ease.

The solution offers two distinct modes of control:
1. Head Movement Mouse Control: Users can effortlessly move the mouse cursor on the screen by tracking the movements of their head.
   This mode provides a smooth and intuitive way to navigate and interact with applications, enabling users to perform tasks such
   as browsing the web, clicking on icons, and opening applications.
2. Head Movement Keyboard Control: In this mode, users can utilize head movements to input text and interact with
   software using an on-screen keyboard.
   The virtual keyboard adapts to the users' head movements, registering their selections and allowing them to compose emails,
   write documents, and engage in any text-based activity.
   By combining both mouse and keyboard control, individuals with disabilities gain full access to the computer's functionalities,
   opening up a world of opportunities for education, communication, and professional pursuits.  This groundbreaking project not only enhances
   computer accessibility for people with disabilities but also fosters a more inclusive digital environment for everyone.
   The implementation of head movement control technology represents a significant step towards bridging the digital divide
   and creating a more equitable and accessible future for all.
